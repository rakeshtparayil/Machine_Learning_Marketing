# Testing and Scoring Methodologies

This repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on unique methodologies for testing and scoring various datasets. The project leverages Python's robust data analysis and machine learning libraries for preprocessing, evaluation, and performance assessment.

## Features

### Workflow Steps:
1. **Importing Data:**
   - Load datasets (e.g., `dataset_X.csv`, `dataset_Y.csv`) for analysis using Pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA to identify trends, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
   - Visualize key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Rename columns for clarity and consistency.
   - Handle missing values and remove irrelevant features.

4. **Defining Testing Methodologies:**
   - Apply statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, chi-square tests) to assess data relationships.
   - Develop scoring metrics based on dataset-specific criteria.

5. **Encoding:**
   - Encode categorical features for compatibility with machine learning models.

6. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.

7. **Modeling and Prediction:**
   - Implement machine learning models to predict outcomes.
   - Customize models based on the unique characteristics of each dataset.

8. **Evaluation and Scoring:**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Generate detailed classification reports and confusion matrices.
   - Compare different scoring methodologies across notebooks.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `sklearn`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
```

## Repository Structure

- **`Creative_Scoring_Fixed_Methodolgy.ipynb`** - Focused on creative scoring using a fixed methodology.
