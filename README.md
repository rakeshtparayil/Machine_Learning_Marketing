# Creative Scoring Predictions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`creative_scoring_predictions.ipynb`) that provides an analysis of creative assets' performance and predicts scores based on key metrics. It leverages Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to explore the dataset and build predictive insights.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Load and clean data from the provided `creatives_c.csv` file.
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and distributions.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Generate insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: 
  - Apply statistical techniques to identify significant predictors.
- **Modeling**: 
  - Build and evaluate predictive models for creative scoring.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/creative-scoring-predictions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd creative-scoring-predictions
   ```
3. Place your `creatives_c.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook creative_scoring_predictions.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis uses a CSV file (`creatives_c.csv`) containing performance metrics for creative assets. Ensure the dataset includes relevant columns for metrics such as:

- **Reach**
- **Engagement**
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
- **Conversions**

## Outputs

- Data visualizations showcasing trends and insights.
- Statistical summaries of key metrics.
- Predictive models for scoring creative assets.
- Recommendations based on analysis results.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the analysis or add new features.
